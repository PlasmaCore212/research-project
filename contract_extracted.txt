1.2GOAL
In the Innovation & Research Project and Bachelor’s Thesis modules, you will dive deeper into technical 
competences and combine them with some general competences. By the end of this module, you’ll be:
-Able to formulate a question from professional field
-Work structured towards a goal
-Get results by own, technical research
-Take conclusions from your technical research
-Reflect on the conclusions
-Formulate advise
-Present your thesis for a jury of specialists
-Create an attitude for Lifelong Learning
How are we going to start?
1.You start by formulating a research question. It could be from an internship company, from an 
inspirational list … A team of teachers will check the level of your question.
2.You perform the practical research at school. The question will be fully researched and technic -
ally implemented during the Innovation & Research Project module in a span of maximum four  
weeks.
You’ll create/research your own solution/design/prototype. It could be pushed into a specific 
direction by your question.
3.In the bachelor’s Thesis you will reflect individually with experts from the industry (for example  
in your internship companies) and with community members that have a great knowledge of 
your project.
Below, you will find a few of the different steps. Your goal is to think critically about the different phases  
of your research. You will create a plan of approach and think about your process. Try to fill in the form 
fields as extensively as possible. You will notice that a great and thorough preparation is a great support 
during the creation of your research project and bachelor’s thesis.\n\n=== NEW PAGE ===\n\nInnovation & Research Project CTAI | Contract plan 32PLAN OF APPROACH
2.1SCOUT THE WORKFIELD AND FILTER
You have received your research question from your teachers, from an internship company, from 
someone else … but now you need to get some more information about this topic. Most likely, you’ll 
already have a little bit of knowledge about this. In some cases, it’s a completely new topic. Maybe the 
question that you have received is still too broad, wide, or generic. You’ll have to dive deeper into your 
topic to get comfortable.
Read, read and read some sources and fetch information. Keep track of all the sources you have en -
countered during your research. The more you read into your topic, the clearer your vision will get. As it 
gets clearer, you can easily define your topic further. Narrowing down is very important: What exactly 
are you going to research? Where is your topic located? What perspective are you going to research? 
Who are the actors that benefit from this research? …  
2.2RESEARCH QUESTION AND SUBQUESTIONS  
This is your main research questions: What question do you wish to research and answer?  
How can a multi-agent system run on local LLMs improve efficiency in 
planning business trips?
2.3SUB QUESTIONS
Write down a bunch of sub questions to structure your project. It will make sure you can split your re -
search in chunks with theoretical and practical parts. Some questions will be answered by a literature 
study. Other questions will only be answered by practically researching everything.
Try to get a minimum of 5 and a maximum of 10 sub questions. It can be a few smaller and some bigger 
questions if needed.
1.What is the impact of adding the Time Management Agent on planning success rate and 
total iterations compared to a system with only Trip Orchestrator, Flight, Hotel, and Policy 
agents?
2.What is the average number of feedback loops between the Policy Compliance Agent and 
booking agents before achieving a valid trip plan, and how does this vary with policy strict -
ness?
3.How many message exchanges are required between agents for successful trip planning 
across different trip complexity levels?
4.How does trip complexity (number of cities, budget constraints, policy violations) affect 
end-to-end planning time in the multi-agent system?\n\n=== NEW PAGE ===\n\nInnovation & Research Project CTAI | Contract plan 45.How does prompt specificity (generic task description vs. domain-expert descriptions) af -
fect policy violation rate and booking accuracy when using the same LLM?
2.4THE RESEARCH PROJECT – TECHNICAL RESEARCH
Goal: Your research question will be technically implemented individually (or in a team of two people) 
during the practical weeks in January, during a period of maximum four weeks. You’ll create/research 
your own solution/design/prototype.
This is the first real practical step as soon as you have formulated your research and sub questions.
You clearly defined what way you want to go to, and now you can formulate all the different steps to get  
to that goal. What components are necessary to reach your goal? How are you going to build these 
components?
TIP: Write down a mind map (or brainstorm) to structure your approach. Talk this through with 
experts/your coach.
What are you going to create as technical research? Make sure your context is well defined, go into 
detail where necessary. Use a plan of approach and include images. Don’t forget any important ele -
ments! Warning: Innovation & Research Project in MCT is always a technical realisation. Only includ -
ing a literature study is not enough.
Which data will you use?
What case will you work out?
Which evaluation or comparison criteria will you use?
What are the minimal requirements of your project / app?
How do you make sure your application is relevant?
What am I building?
This project develops a proof-of-concept multi-agent system that uses local LLMs to automate business 
trip planning. The system employs four specialized AI agents that work together to find flights, hotels, 
and ensure everything follows company travel policies. Unlike traditional sequential approaches, this 
architecture enables parallel processing and iterative refinement through bidirectional feedback loops.
Technical components
The architecture consists of five specialized agents working in a hub-and-spoke pattern:
Trip Orchestrator
Flight Agent
Hotel Agent
Policy Compliance Agent
Time Management Agent
The Trip Orchestrator will serve as a central coordinator, managing workflow and communication be -
tween agents. The Flight Agent handles flight search and price optimization, while the Hotel Agent finds 
suitable accommodations near business locations. The Policy Compliance Agent validates all bookings 
against company rules and can make agents redo their work if violations occur. The Time Management 
Agent will ensure that meetings and travel times do not overlap. It will consider the travel time from the  \n\n=== NEW PAGE ===\n\nInnovation & Research Project CTAI | Contract plan 5airport to the hotel for example. It will calculate the distances using longitudes and latitudes from loca -
tions.
What sets this apart from a waterfall approach is the coordination model. Flight and Hotel agents exe -
cute operate simultaneously rather than serial. When the Policy agent sees any violation, it sends feed -
back through the Orchestrator to agents for other options without restarting the entire process.
The system will run on a local Ollama model (not yet sure what model), utilizing system prompts to give 
each agent domain-specific expertise. All the agents share the same base model, but they receive differ -
ent prompts and instructions specifically chosen for their role. This way, memory usage will remain at 
the lower end.
For communication, RabbitMQ handles messages between agents. Redis maintains a shared state acces -
sible to all agents. The complete technology includes Python with FastAPI for the backend, LangGraph 
for agent workflow management, and Ollama for local model serving. A basic HTML, CSS and Javascript 
web interface will be created for user interaction.
Data Sources
The project uses fully synthetic data for both flights and hotels across four cities: New York City, San 
Francisco, Chicago, and Boston. While real-world APIs are possible, they add extra complexity such as 
rate limits and costs.
The dataset is designed to be realistic. It includes plausible flight and hotel prices, and actual geographi -
cal coordinates for location. At the same time it allows us to create challenging test cases to push the 
agents and see how well they handle conflicts.
2.5TECHNICAL RESEARCH: SUCCESS CRITERIA
Now that you have well defined how your project will be made, it is important to define some goals and 
success criteria. When is your project finished according to your standards? Describe a few of your 
results that you want to achieve. Use a list.
What will your technical demo or proof-of-concept contain? When is your project finished? What if 
you’re done in a few weeks, and you want to do some alternatives?
Technical Performance Targets
The system is designed to make multi-city business trip planning faster and more efficient. Success will 
be measured as follows:
Simple trips should be planned within a few minutes, compared to 30-40 minutes manually.
The system should be able to identify bookings that are within budget
All five agents must work together smoothly
Messages sent via RabbitMQ should be delivered consistently
Redis state should remain accurate and conflict free\n\n=== NEW PAGE ===\n\nInnovation & Research Project CTAI | Contract plan 6Meeting and travel times should not overlap with one another; conflicts will trigger adjust -
ments
Functional Requirements
The system should contain the following:
Users can enter trip requirements using a web interface built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript
The system returns complete trips with flight and booking information
Any violations are flagged, with explanations so users understand why certain options are re -
jected
Performance metrics must be collected for each scenario and statistical analysis should be done  
to show that a multi-agent system performs better than manual bookings
Technical Demo
The technical demo will show the system planning trips in real-time using the synthetic dataset of flights  
and hotels. The demo will include:
User input of trip requirements
Dynamic coordination between all agents
Display of results including flights, hotels, and runtime
Metrics visualization for speed and efficiency
Extras
If the project is completed before schedule, these are some extra goals:
Adding multiple business trips in one go
Adding more cities
PDF export of the final trip planned out\n\n=== NEW PAGE ===\n\nInnovation & Research Project CTAI | Contract plan 72.6HANDING IN YOUR RESEARCH PROJECT
